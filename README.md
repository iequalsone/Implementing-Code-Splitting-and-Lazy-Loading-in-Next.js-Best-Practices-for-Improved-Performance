# Implementing Code Splitting and Lazy Loading in Next.js: Best Practices for Improved Performance

Welcome to the repository for "Implementing Code Splitting and Lazy Loading in Next.js: Best Practices for Improved Performance." This repository contains all the code examples presented in my related LinkedIn article that discusses optimizing your Next.js application for better performance through code splitting and lazy loading.

## Overview

Code splitting and lazy loading are critical techniques for improving the performance of your Next.js applications. By splitting large JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks and loading only what's necessary, you can significantly improve load times and user experience.

In this repository, you'll find examples showcasing:

- How to implement **code splitting** in Next.js.
- **Lazy loading** components to enhance perceived performance.
- Best practices for **dynamic imports** using Next.js features.
- **React Suspense** for managing loading states effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. Code Splitting
Code splitting in Next.js is automatically handled by Webpack, but in this repository, we go a step further to demonstrate how you can leverage the following to optimize your app:

- **Dynamic Imports** using `next/dynamic` for components that are not immediately needed.
- **Loadable Components** to ensure that only the essential parts of your application are loaded initially.

### 2. Lazy Loading Components
The repository provides examples of lazy loading components using `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense` for better user experience. Lazy loading can help reduce the initial load time by deferring non-critical JavaScript.

### 3. Best Practices
We showcase best practices such as:

- Using **Suspense fallback** to show loading indicators.
- **Chunk splitting** for better caching and faster re-renders.
- **Conditional Loading** of components based on user interactions.

# Usage Examples

## Dynamic Import Example

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});

export default function DynamicPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dynamic Import Example</h1>
      <DynamicComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## React Suspense Example

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
const LazyLoadedComponent = React.lazy(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'));

export default function SuspenseExample() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Suspense Example</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyLoadedComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```
